A replicate of how Spotify play screen looks. Interacting you can do with it is the like, shuffle, repeat, pause/play button and the slider.
I had to concult a few websites and ChatGPT on how to create the slider and change the time along with the slider. Also I had to look up the different colors available to me in SwiftUI. SF symbols names were also looked up. Concepts I used were taught thorugh the UNC app_team ios-bootcamp like how different stacks worked, different fonts and how images can be added onto the screen. The concept of toggle and button action I learned from my last project Instagram.
In the future, I want to add in an actual song that will play along with the what is on the screen right now.
